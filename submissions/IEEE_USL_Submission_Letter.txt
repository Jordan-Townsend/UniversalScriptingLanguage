To the IEEE Standards Committee,

I am submitting a proposal for a new symbolic logic format and runtime standard titled:

  Universal Scripting Language (USL): A Symbolic Compression, Encryption, and Transpilation Runtime

USL is a lightweight, secure, and interoperable encoding system for symbolic logic. It supports 605+ programming languages and includes advanced compression (.uslc), quantum-resilient encryption (.uslbq), and format conversion (.usl, .uslb, .uslpack).

Sincerely,
